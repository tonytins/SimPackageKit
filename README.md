# SimPackageKit

This is a port of SimPE's interface and helper library to Swift. It does not yet provide any default implementations *yet*.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Swift 5.3 or later

## Supported Platforms

### Minimum macOS version

As of Swift 5, the minimum supported version of macOS is 10.10 Yosemite but Sims 2: Super Collection only supports macOS 10.12.6 Sierra or later. In order to avoid any future compatibility problems, SimPackageKit's minimum macOS target is the same as the Super Collection.
