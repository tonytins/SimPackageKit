# SimPackageKit

This is a port of SimPE's interfaces and helper libraries to Swift.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Swift 5.3 or later

## Supported Platforms

SimPackageKit is supported on any platform that Swift 5.3 or later supports.

### Minimum macOS version

As of Swift 5, the minimum supported version of macOS is 10.10 Yosemite but Sims 2: Super Collection only supports macOS 10.12.6 Sierra or later. SimPackageKit enforces the same minimum as Super Collection's in order to avoid any future problems with potential tools accidentally targetting lower then what is actually supported by the game.
