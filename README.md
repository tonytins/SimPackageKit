# SimPackageKit

This is a port of SimPE's interface and helper library to Swift. It does not yet provide any default implementations *yet*.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Swift 5.3 or later

## Supported Platforms

### Minimum macOS version

As of Swift 5, the minimum supported version of macOS is 10.10 Yosemite but Sims 2: Super Collection only supports macOS 10.12.6 Sierra or later. SimPackageKit enforces the same minimum as Super Collection's in order to avoid any future problems with potential tools accidentally targetting lower then what is actually supported by the game.
